# Ecom sales dataset ingestion, cleaning, manipulation and transformation

This is a small python program that reads in a sales dataset.
It then uses native pandas functions to clean, manipulate and transform the data.
E.g. it calculates total sales, extracts order weekdays and months.
Also, tabulate is used for prettier printing of the final datasets.

## Installation

Just clone the repository and run ecommerce_sales.py

## Usage

The file cannot be used directly for other datasets, but you can follow similar logic and functions
to create your own data transformation scripts.
